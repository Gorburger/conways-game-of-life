A recreation of Conway's game of life made with Godot, utilizing tilemaps and dictionaries

Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player cellular automaton that simulates a universe of cells governed by a simple set of rules.The state of a cell in the next generation is determined by its current state and the states of its eight neighbors (the cells that touch it horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

There are four rules that dictate the evolution of the game:

    1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.

    2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.

    3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.

    4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

These simple rules can lead to surprisingly complex and unpredictable patterns.
